Analysis:  
1. We find that the average effective care scores and survey scores are negatively correlated. This is a bit surprising finding. Maybe the survey responses are filled by people who are not happy with the service. 
2. The average readmission score and the survey scores are also negatively correlated.  
3. There is no data for veterans hospital for patient surveys. So we have no correlation data for the veterans hospital.
